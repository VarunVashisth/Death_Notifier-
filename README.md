# Death_Notifier-
Everyone one of us experience procrastination or losing hope to live or just don't live our life at its fullest ; thats why this python script for automated notification to remind you - you can die at any time  (total brainrot shit but yeah)

## working(based on ubuntu commands may vary for windows)
clone the file then create a virtual environment using **"python3 -m venv venv"** after that activate the environment using **source venv/bin/activate** 
<br><br>
Use requirement.txt file for installing dependecies with "pip install requirement.txt"

for ubuntu to make this work in background 
**nohup python3 notify.py** 

for stopping: <br> 
**ps aux | grep python**  (find notify.py and its id) 

**kill -9 ID** (use that notify.py ID here)
