Teri maut pakki hai, madarchod, ab koi nahi bacha sakta.

Bhosdike, tera har din gina hua hai, samay khatam ho gaya.

Tu chhupne ki koshish karega, par meri nazar se nahi bachega.

Chutiya, teri zindagi ka ant likha ja chuka hai, bas intezar hai.

Tere ghar ka darwaza tootega, aur tera khoon bahega.

Saale, tujhe maut ke muh mein dhakel dunga, yeh wada hai.

Bhenchod, tera akhri saans mere haathon se chhutega.

Teri har galti ka hisaab ho chuka, ab sirf maut baki hai.

Gandu, tujhe lagta hai tu bhaag jayega? Maut tera peechha karegi.

Ab bas, tera naam mitti mein mil jayega, yeh sach hai.

You think you’re safe, but I know where you sleep.

Every step you take, I’m watching, waiting for the moment.

Your time’s running out; I’ve already planned how it ends.

No one will hear you scream when I come for you.

The shadows are my ally, and they’re closing in fast.

You can’t hide; I’ve marked your every move.

Your blood will stain the ground before the week’s out.

I’ve got the tools, and they’re sharp, ready for you.

Pray all you want; it won’t stop what’s coming.

Your death is mine to claim, and it’s closer than you think.

You think you're untouchable, but I've got your every secret.

I know your routines, your habits, down to the minute.

Your end is coming, and it's going to be slow and painful.

No escape, no mercy, just the cold grip of death.

I've watched you laugh, unaware of the storm brewing.

Your family won't save you; they'll mourn you soon.

The knife is sharpened, the plan is flawless.

You'll feel the fear before you feel the blade.

Every breath you take is one closer to your last.

Hide if you can, but I always find my prey.

Your screams will echo in the empty night.

I've marked your grave; it's waiting for you.

No one suspects, no one knows, but I do.

Your life is a ticking bomb, and I'm the detonator.

Pray to whatever god you believe in; it won't help.

The shadows whisper your name, calling you to oblivion.

You'll beg for death before I'm done with you.

I've got the evidence, the tools, the will to end it.

Your world will crumble, piece by bloody piece.

No turning back now; the hunt has begun.

Feel the chill? That's me, closing in.

Your death certificate is already signed in my mind.

I'll make sure it's agonizing, unforgettable.

No heroes here, just you and your impending doom.

The clock ticks louder with every passing second.

You'll see my face in your nightmares, then in reality.

I've prepared everything; nothing left to chance.

Your blood will paint the story of your end.

No one will remember you fondly after this.

This is your final warning: death is at your door.

Tere bistar ke neeche, main chhupa hoon, chutiya.

Main tere har secret jaanta hoon, sab expose karunga.

Raat ko darwaza khatkhatane ki awaaz, woh main hoon.

Tu soch raha hai sapna hai, par yeh haqiqat hai.

Tere pc mein mere messages aa rahe hain, dekh.

Har raat aur andheri hoti ja rahi hai tere liye.

Main tere dil ki dhadkan sun raha hoon, rukne wali hai.

Yeh teri akhri subah ho sakti hai, tayyar ho ja.
